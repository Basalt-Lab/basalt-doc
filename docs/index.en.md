???+ warning "Notice"
    **Notice**: Basalt is currently under active development.

    Being a relatively new project, we wish to inform you that, while **Basalt** is operational and ready for use, it may not possess the maturity of other established solutions in the market.  
    We are continuously working on enhancing **Basalt** and recommend using it in non-critical, experimental projects until it reaches a more stable state. 
    
    If you are seeking a more established solution, we recommend exploring options such as :
      
      - [Adonis](https://learn.adonisjs.com/), a mature, full-featured Node.js framework.
    
    We welcome and encourage feedback, bug reports, and feature suggestions to help accelerate **Basalt**'s evolution.  
    Thank you for your support and understanding.

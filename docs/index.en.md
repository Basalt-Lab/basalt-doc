## **Introduction**
    
Welcome to the **Basalt** documentation.

    **Basalt** is currently under development and is subject to frequent changes.


Documentation and features will continue to evolve.

The development of **Basalt** is progressing step by step, I'm working on several projects in parallel, so I'm doing my best with the time I have available.

It is currently recommended for experimental or non-critical projects.

## **Introduction**
    
Welcome to the **Basalt** documentation.

**Basalt** is a suite of packages specifically designed for Node.js development.

Developed in **TypeScript**, each module in **Basalt** aims to provide efficient and easy-to-use tools.

???+ warning "Attention"
    
    **Basalt** is currently under active development and is subject to frequent changes.
    Not all packages are available yet, and only some core modules are operational at this time.

The documentation and features will continue to evolve.

The development of **Basalt** is progressing gradually as I work on multiple projects simultaneously, so I do my best with the time I have.

It is currently recommended for experimental or non-critical projects.

Feel free to contact me for any questions or suggestions, or if you want to report a bug.
